## Usage

### Markdown

The filter recognizes code blocks with the `.pyplot` class present in Markdown documents. It will run the script in the associated code block in a Python interpreter and capture the generated Matplotlib figure.

Here is a basic example using the scripting `matplotlib.pyplot` API:

```markdown
    ```{.pyplot}
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    plt.figure()
    plt.plot([0,1,2,3,4], [1,2,3,4,5])
    plt.title('This is an example figure')
    ```
```

Putting the above in `input.md`, we can then generate the plot and embed it:

```bash
pandoc --filter pandoc-pyplot input.md --output output.html
```

or

```bash
pandoc --filter pandoc-pyplot input.md --output output.pdf
```

or any other output format you want.

### LaTeX

The filter works slightly differently in LaTeX documents. In LaTeX, the `minted` environment must be used, with the `pyplot` class. 

```latex
\begin{minted}{pyplot}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure()
plt.plot([0,1,2,3,4], [1,2,3,4,5])
plt.title('This is an example figure')
\end{minted}
```

Note that __you do not need to have `minted` installed__.

There are more examples in the [source repository](https://github.com/LaurentRDC/pandoc-pyplot), in the `\examples` directory.

## Features

### Captions

You can also specify a caption for your image. This is done using the optional `caption` parameter.

__Markdown__:

```markdown
    ```{.pyplot caption="This is a simple figure"}
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

    plt.figure()
    plt.plot([0,1,2,3,4], [1,2,3,4,5])
    plt.title('This is an example figure')
    ```
```

__LaTex__:

```latex
\begin{minted}[caption=This is a simple figure]{pyplot}
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

plt.figure()
plt.plot([0,1,2,3,4], [1,2,3,4,5])
plt.title('This is an example figure')
\end{minted}
```

Caption formatting is either plain text or Markdown. LaTeX-style math is also support in captions (using dollar signs $...$).

### Link to source code and high-resolution figure

In case of an output format that supports links (e.g. HTML), the embedded image generated by `pandoc-pyplot` will be a link to the source code which was used to generate the file. Therefore, other people can see what Python code was used to create your figures. A high resolution image will be made available in a caption link.

(*New in version 2.1.3.0*) For cleaner output (e.g. PDF), you can turn this off via the `links=false` key:

__Markdown__:

```markdown
    ```{.pyplot links=false}
    ...
    ```
```

__LaTex__:

```latex
\begin{minted}[links=false]{pyplot}
...
\end{minted}
```

or via a [configuration file](#Configurable).

### Including scripts

If you find yourself always repeating some steps, inclusion of scripts is possible using the `include` parameter. For example, if you want all plots to have the [`ggplot`](https://matplotlib.org/tutorials/introductory/customizing.html#sphx-glr-tutorials-introductory-customizing-py) style, you can write a very short preamble `style.py` like so:

```python
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
plt.style.use('ggplot')
```

and include it in your document as follows:

```markdown
    ```{.pyplot include=style.py}
    plt.figure()
    plt.plot([0,1,2,3,4], [1,2,3,4,5])
    plt.title('This is an example figure')
    ```
```

Which is equivalent to writing the following markdown:

```markdown
    ```{.pyplot}
    import matplotlib.pyplot as plt
    plt.style.use('ggplot')

    plt.figure()
    plt.plot([0,1,2,3,4], [1,2,3,4,5])
    plt.title('This is an example figure')
    ```
```

The equivalent LaTeX usage is as follows:

```latex
\begin{minted}[include=style.py]{pyplot}

\end{minted}
```

This `include` parameter is perfect for longer documents with many plots. Simply define the style you want in a separate script! You can also import packages this way, or define functions you often use.

### No wasted work

`pandoc-pyplot` minimizes work, only generating figures if it absolutely must. Therefore, you can confidently run the filter on very large documents containing dozens of figures --- like a book or a thesis --- and only the figures which have recently changed will be re-generated.

### Compatibility with pandoc-crossref

[`pandoc-crossref`](https://github.com/lierdakil/pandoc-crossref) is a pandoc filter that makes it effortless to cross-reference objects on documents. 

You can use `pandoc-crossref` in conjunction with `pandoc-pyplot` for the ultimate figure-making pipeline. You can combine both in a figure like so:

```markdown
    ```{#fig:myexample .pyplot caption="This is a caption"}
    # Insert figure script here
    ```

    As you can see in @fig:myexample, ...
```

If the above source is located in file `myfile.md`, you can render the figure and references by applying `pandoc-pyplot` **first**, and then `pandoc-crossref`. For example:

```bash
pandoc --filter pandoc-pyplot --filter pandoc-crossref -i myfile.md -o myfile.html
```

### Configurable

(*New in version 2.1.0.0*) To avoid repetition, `pandoc-pyplot` can be configured using simple YAML files. `pandoc-pyplot` will look for a `.pandoc-pyplot.yml` file in the current working directory:

```yaml
# You can specify any or all of the following parameters
interpreter: python36
directory: mydirectory/
include: mystyle.py
format: jpeg
links: false
dpi: 150
flags: [-O, -Wignore]
```

These values override the default values, which are equivalent to:

```yaml
# Defaults if no configuration is provided.
# Note that the default interpreter name on MacOS and Unix is 'python3'
# and 'python' on Windows.
interpreter: python
flags: []
directory: generated/
format: png
links: true
dpi: 80
```

Using `pandoc-pyplot --write-example-config` will write the default configuration to a file `.pandoc-pyplot.yml`, which you can then customize.

## Installation

### Binaries

Windows binaries are available on [GitHub](https://github.com/LaurentRDC/pandoc-pyplot/releases). Place the executable in a location that is in your PATH to be able to call it.

If you can show me how to generate binaries for other platform using e.g. Azure Pipelines, let me know!

### Installers (Windows)

Windows installers are made available thanks to [Inno Setup](http://www.jrsoftware.org/isinfo.php). You can download them from the [release page](https://github.com/LaurentRDC/pandoc-pyplot/releases/latest).

### From Hackage/Stackage

`pandoc-pyplot` is available on Hackage. Using the [`cabal-install`](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/) tool:

```bash
cabal update
cabal install pandoc-pyplot
```

Similarly, `pandoc-pyplot` is available on Stackage:

```bash
stack update
stack install pandoc-pyplot
```

### From source

Building from source can be done using [`stack`](https://docs.haskellstack.org/en/stable/README/) or [`cabal`](https://www.haskell.org/cabal/):

```bash
git clone https://github.com/LaurentRDC/pandoc-pyplot
cd pandoc-pylot
stack install # Alternatively, `cabal install`
```

## Running the filter

### Requirements

This filter only works with the Matplotlib plotting library. Therefore, you a Python interpreter and at least [Matplotlib](https://matplotlib.org/) installed. The name of the Python interpreter to use can be specified in a `.pandoc-pyplot.yml` file; by default, `pandoc-pyplot` will use the `"python"` name on Windows, and `"python3"` otherwise.

You can use the filter with Pandoc as follows:

```bash
pandoc --filter pandoc-pyplot input.md --output output.html
```

In which case, the output is HTML. Another example with PDF output:

```bash
pandoc --filter pandoc-pyplot input.md --output output.pdf
```

Python exceptions will be printed to screen in case of a problem.

`pandoc-pyplot` has a limited command-line interface. Take a look at the help available using the `-h` or `--help` argument:

```bash
pandoc-pyplot --help
```

## Usage as a Haskell library

To include the functionality of `pandoc-pyplot` in a Haskell package, you can use the `makePlot :: Block -> IO Block` function (for single blocks) or `plotTransform :: Pandoc -> IO Pandoc` function (for entire documents).

### Usage with Hakyll

This filter was originally designed to be used with [Hakyll](https://jaspervdj.be/hakyll/). In case you want to use the filter with your own Hakyll setup, you can use a transform function that works on entire documents:

```haskell
import Text.Pandoc.Filter.Pyplot (plotTransform)

import Hakyll

-- Unsafe compiler is required because of the interaction
-- in IO (i.e. running an external Python script).
makePlotPandocCompiler :: Compiler (Item String)
makePlotPandocCompiler =
  pandocCompilerWithTransformM
    defaultHakyllReaderOptions
    defaultHakyllWriterOptions
    (unsafeCompiler . plotTransform)
```

The `plotTransformWithConfig` is also available for a more configurable set-up.

## Warning

Do not run this filter on unknown documents. There is nothing in `pandoc-pyplot` that can stop a Python script from performing **evil actions**.
